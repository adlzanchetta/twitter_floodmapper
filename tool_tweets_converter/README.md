# Tweets converter

*Plain Python tool for converting raw JSON tweets file into clean CSV files.*

## About

This tool basically:

1. Reads a ```json``` file that was generated by the ```twitter harvester``` tool;
2. Sepatates geotagged from non-geotagged messages;
3. Writes two ```csv``` files, one with geo-locations, other without.

It was tested in Python 3.7.

## Usage

Two arguments are necessary: 
- the file path of the input ```json``` file that was generated by the ```twitter harvester``` tool;
- the folder path in which the output ```csv``` files will be generated.

A typical call would be in the form of:

    $ python main.py some_file_path.json \(...)\some_folder_path\

The user must have write permissions on the output folder path.
